License key
-----------
After you buy the commercial license, you will receive a license key of your copy of the software. It will be available in
your account at [my.handsontable.com](https://my.handsontable.com/).

Paste your license key to the configuration section, just like in the example below.



    var container = document.getElementById('example');
    var hot = new Handsontable(container, {
      data: data,
      rowHeaders: true,
      colHeaders: true,
      licenseKey: '00000-00000-00000-00000-00000'
    });


Note that the license key is passed as a string so you need to wrap it with quotes ('').
